## Creating and Managing Habits

### How can I mark a Habit as complete?
To mark a habit as complete, navigate to the **View Habits** screen, and click on the habit. A menu will appear giving you the option to **‘Mark Complete’**, **‘View Progress’**, **‘Edit’** or **‘Delete’** the habit.

After clicking **Mark Complete**, a confirmation message will appear. If you have already marked the habit as complete today, a message will appear advising **‘Habit already marked complete today!’**

---

### How can I delete a Habit?
To delete a habit, navigate to the **View Habits** screen, tap on the habit you would like to delete, and select **‘Delete’**.

---

### I Completed my habit yesterday but I forgot to mark it complete, can I mark previous days as complete?
Absolutely. The important thing is you completed your habit! To do this:

- Open the Progress screen for the habit you want to update. (**View Habits** -> Click the Habit -> Click **View Progress**)
- Find the day you want to mark complete on the Completions Calendar
- Click on the day you want to mark complete
- A confirmation window will appear, asking if you'd like to mark that day as complete.
- After clicking yes, the day will be marked complete

**Note:** You cannot mark a day before the habit's start date as complete.

### How are the Weekly and Monthly Completion scores calculated?
The **Weekly** and **Monthly Completion** scores are calculated based on how many times you completed the habit this week/month compared to how many times the habit is expected to be completed this week/month.

This calculation considers the Habit Frequency. For example:

- Completing a habit **once per week** for a **Daily Habit**, which is expected to be completed every day, will give a weekly completion score of **14%** (1 out of 7 expected days).
- Completing a habit **once this week** for a **Weekly Habit** will give a Weekly Score of **100%**.

For **Custom Habits**, if a habit is expected to be completed on **Tuesday** and **Thursday**, and you complete the habit on **Tuesday**, this week’s Weekly Score will be **50%**.

As **Monthly Habits** are not expected to be completed every week, they are not given a Weekly Score. As long as the habit is completed **once this month**, it will receive a **100% Monthly Score**.

---

### Why is the completion score in my Monthly Report and View Progress different?
In the **View Progress** page, the completion score shows your progress as it builds up over time throughout the month. It starts at 0% and increases as you complete your habit, giving you a sense of your progress so far.

In the **Monthly Report**, the completion score reflects your overall consistency for the month. It starts at 100% and decreases only when you miss an expected completion date. This score is a great way to measure how consistent you were in maintaining the habit over the entire month.

---

### How can I set up the Habit to be completed on specific days?
When creating a habit, you have the option to select a **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Custom** frequency for the habit.

To specify which days the habit should be completed:
1. In the **Add Habit** screen, click the **Frequency** option (the default is Daily).
2. Select **Custom**.
3. The **Day Selection Menu** will appear, and you can select the days of the week you would like to perform this habit.

---

### How can I view the statistics of my Habit?
Individual **Habit Statistics** can be found by:
1. Navigating to the **View Habits** screen.
2. Clicking on the desired habit and selecting **‘View Progress’**.

Here you can view the following:
- A **Completions Calendar** highlighting the days the habit was completed.
- Your **Current and Best Streak** for habit completions.
- **This Week’s** and **This Month’s** completion scores.
- A **Bar Graph** displaying the total completions of each month over the past year.

The **Monthly Report**, which can be accessed by clicking the **View Reports** button on the **Home Screen**, provides a summary of your performance on all habits over the past month. This includes:
- Completion rates
- Streaks
- Monthly consistency (how many months you completed the habit every day it was expected)

The report also highlights:
- **Most consistent habits**
- **Frequently missed habits** that may need improvement.

---

### What do the colors on the Monthly Report mean?
In the **Monthly Report**, your habits are color-coded based on their completion rate. This provides a visual representation of which habits you are consistent in and which habits may need improving:

- **Green**: 80% completion and above
- **Yellow**: 40% completion and above
- **Red**: Below 40% completion

### How do I Set Reminders for my Habits?
Reminders can be a great way to improve consistency with your habits. To set up Habit Reminders:
1. **Open the Settings Page**: Navigate to the **Settings** screen by tapping the gear icon on the top-right corner of the Home screen.
2. Manage Reminders: Tap on "**Reminders**" to open the Reminder Settings view.
3. **Enable Reminders:** You will see a list of your habits. You can use the toggle switch next to each habit to enable/disable reminders

Once reminders are enabled, the app will automatically schedule notifications for your habits based on their frequency:

- **Daily Habits**: Notifications are triggered every day
- **Weekly Habits**:Notifications appear only on the specific day of the week the habit is due (e.g Tuesday).
- **Monthly Habits**: Notifications are sent on the specific day of the month the habit is scheduled (e.g the 16th).
- **Custom Habits**: Notifications will be sent out only on the specific days (e.g Tuesday, Thursday)

**Important**: Notifications do need to be enabled for the app to deliver the reminders successfully. You can enable/disable reminders for habits at any time.
